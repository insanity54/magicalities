minetest mod that adds magic

The original mod author abandoned the mod, so I'm taking over as maintainer


## Usage

1. First you gotta craft a wand. There is one wand you can craft without needing to level up-- iron wand.
2. Next you gotta get a magic book. get the book by hitting a bookshelf with your wand

(more to come, once I figure out how to use the mod)
